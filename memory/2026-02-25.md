# Session Log — February 25, 2026

## Session 2 (Evening)

### Workspace Cleanup
- Removed redundant sections from SOUL.md (Session Initialization + Rate Limits)
- Updated AGENTS.md to reference memory/MEMORY.md (not workspace root)
- Moved MEMORY.md from workspace root → memory/MEMORY.md (stops auto-injection, still searchable)
- Created BOOTSTRAP.md to kill [MISSING] noise
- Removed Pending Integrations from MEMORY.md (Slack, Fathom, GHL all resolved)

### Meta Ads Token
- Old token had expired (Feb 24). Dylan provided new permanent System User token.
- Updated meta-ads/credentials.json. Token verified working.

### Fathom Seller Analysis (90-day pull)
- 342 total meetings in Fathom, 15 genuine seller-side calls in last 90 days
- Top finding: valuation gap is #1 deal killer (sellers expect 4–5x, ZKW offers 1.5–3.25x)
- Most sellers are ambition-driven (want capital for next venture), not burned out
- Offer differentiators that land: all cash, no earn-out, no non-compete, 40–90 day close
