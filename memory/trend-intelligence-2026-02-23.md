# ZKW Trend Intelligence — Feb 23, 2026

## Top Ad Angles Identified
1. **AI Destroying Agency Model** (BEST) — Agencies losing value monthly; ZKW = rational exit before repricing
2. **Founder Burnout** — "You built this for freedom" — best for retargeting warm audiences
3. **Hustle Culture Dead** — Permission to stop grinding; all-cash exit as identity reframe
4. **Agency Margins Shrinking** — Empathy + math; "working more for less"
5. **"I Quit" Viral Moment** — Story-led UGC testimonial format
6. **Recession Anxiety** — Timing/scarcity; lock in 3X before window closes
7. **Soft Life Aspiration** — Dream-state activation; contrast to agency grind

## Recommended Test
