## Sales Deck Slideshow System — Built from scratch

**Problem:** Dylan was manually making Canva slideshows for deal listings (~1 every 2 weeks). Wanted to automate.

**Canva API:** Explored but dead end — Canva developer portal requires MFA, MFA option missing from Dylan's free account.

**Solution built:** Self-contained HTML/JS slideshows embedded via iframe in GoHighLevel landing pages.

**First deck built:** Project Tint (niche automotive aftermarket Meta ads agency, 56 clients, $455K rev, 50.5% EBITDA)
- 16 slides, exact structure matching existing Canva decks
- Full FY2025 P&L table on financials slide (not a teaser)
- ZKW logo embedded as base64, bottom left every slide
- No CTA button — landing page handles it
- Language sharpened using market demand doc (AI premium framing, valuation discount vs comps)

**Market demand doc reviewed:** What makes agency deals sell fast (recurring rev, owner removed, AI integration, niche, low concentration, clean financials). Used to sharpen slide copy.
